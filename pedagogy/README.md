#### 1. Focus Area :
Our experiment is all about the addition of two binary numbers. As in ripple carry adders, for each adder block, the two bits that are to be added are available instantly. However, each adder block waits for the carry to arrive from its previous block. So, it is not possible to generate the sum and carry of any block until the input carry is known. The (i)th block waits for the (i-1)th block to produce its carry. So there will be a considerable time delay which is carry propagation delay.It reduces the propagation delay by more complex hardware. It is implemented with the help of logic gates.

#### 3. About the Experiment:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. 
<br>
<div>
 Firstly take two binary numbers to perform experiment.To get the addition take Ai and Bi digit by digit from the end. In carry look ahead adder two variables such as “carry propagate(Pi) ” and “carry generate(Gi)” are defined.After that carry (Ci) is generated with the help of Pi and Gi. The carry is stored in C(i+1) and the sum(Si) is stored in Pi.Ci .Repeat the same process till the sum of all the digits is calculated. Its complexity is log(n).

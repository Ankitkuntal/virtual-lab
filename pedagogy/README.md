#### 3. About the Experiment:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. 
<br>
<div>
    In carry look ahead adder two variables such as “carry propagate” and “carry generate” are defined.
 The sum is stored in Si and the carry is stored in C(i+1). Boolean functions are implemented for carry output such as C2, C3, C4 then generated. Its complexity is log(n).
